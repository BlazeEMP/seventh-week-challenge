  ## Installation

  * Download and install Node Package Manager in your development environment so you can invoke the program from the command line  
  * Download the utils generateMarkdown.js file and implement the code in index.js into the file from which you'd like to invoke the program. Or you can use the project and files as is for a standalone experience.  
  * (Only the 'packages.json', 'generateMarkdown.js' and 'index.js' files are required.)  
  * Once everything is in place or downloaded. From the primary file 'index.js' or your file, run ```npm i``` in your terminal to prepare everything.

  ## Usage

  To use the program if implemented into your own project file, invoke 'node filename.js' from your development console in the main file. The file will generate in your project directory where the main file you invoked from is.  

  For use as a standalone CLI program, take the project folder and use 'node index.js' in the index.js file terminal. You can then use the generated README wherever you'd like to from there.  
  
  The README is generated with the format titleName-README.md for the filename. If you need to regenerate but would like to use the file you had for something, changing the title will create a different file rather than overwriting, using the same title will simply overwrite any file of the same name in the same directory.
